# Delicious Sums: A game for Ludum Dare 54

This game was made in 72 hours as part of Ludum Dare 54 ("the jam" category).

A puzzle game with dim sum. Fit dim sum onto your plate cleverly to score as many points as possible. Why dim sum? Because we were hungry.

Built with Godot 4.1.1. All assets other than fonts and the game engine are original and were created during the jam.
