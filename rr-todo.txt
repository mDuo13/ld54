graphics wants:

- score screen pictures
- steamer basket(s?) for pieces to sit on
- project icon

nice to have:

- audio levels config / mute button
- real bgm / fix playback and transitioning w/ scenes
- tutorial / howto screen(s)
- sfx
- playable on macos / ios
- game balance
    - risk of having new blockers dropped on you?
- fade effect on scene transition

stretch goals:

- better bonus scoring animation
- undo button
- randomized scoring objectives
- more balanced board rando (e.g. don't dump all the blockers on the same side)
- animate cart loading in
- set/load a given board seed
- detect when the player literally can't play/score more
